# HK Alpha Team

HK Alpha Team is an **AI-assisted Hong Kong equity research and investment strategy advisory system**.

It supports human decision-making through structured analysis, strategy proposals, paper trading records, simulation reviews, and iterative learning artifacts.

## Important Scope Boundary

HK Alpha Team is **not** an automated trading system.

- It does not execute real-money trades.
- It does not connect to broker execution APIs for autonomous order placement.
- It does not replace human judgment.

All real-money decisions remain under human control.

## Human-in-the-Loop Governance

The human user acts as **Harness Engineering** and is responsible for:

- Final investment decision approval.
- Risk acceptance and capital allocation decisions.
- Oversight of research quality, model behavior, and simulation integrity.

## Strategy Recommendation Labels

Preferred strategy labels:

- `STRONG_WATCH`
- `WAIT_FOR_PULLBACK`
- `SMALL_POSITION`
- `ACCUMULATE`
- `HOLD`
- `REDUCE_RISK`
- `AVOID`

## Phase 2 Migration/Validation Baseline (PR #4)

- `supabase/migrations/0001_create_core_schema.sql` — **draft-only** core schema migration baseline generated from canonical schema docs.
- `docs/15-migration-assumptions.md` — explicit schema interpretation assumptions and deferred items for the draft migration.
- `scripts/validate_contracts.py` — lightweight validator for contract-lock surfaces and sensitive-assignment scanning.
- `.github/workflows/contract-check.yml` — CI workflow that runs contract validation on PRs and pushes to `main`.

This migration is draft-only and **must not be applied to production Supabase** without Harness Engineering review and explicit approval.

Applying this draft migration to production Supabase remains out of scope during Phase 2.


## Phase 2 Local/Test SQL Validation (PR #5)

- `scripts/check_migration_sql.sh` — local/test PostgreSQL migration execution validator.
- `.github/workflows/sql-migration-check.yml` — CI workflow that runs contract + migration checks.
- `docs/16-local-sql-validation.md` — runbook and governance notes for local/test validation.
- `docs/17-backend-skeleton.md` — Phase 3 backend skeleton baseline, local/test scope, and CI/testing contract notes.

Phase 2 validation is limited to local/test PostgreSQL execution checks. Applying migrations to production Supabase remains out of scope in this phase.

The `sql-migration-check` workflow validates that the draft migration executes successfully in local/test PostgreSQL context before backend skeleton work proceeds.


## Phase 3 Backend Skeleton Foundation (PR #6)

- `backend/app/main.py` — FastAPI application entrypoint with `GET /health` and `GET /api/v1/project-status`.
- `backend/app/contracts.py` — shared success/error response envelope helpers aligned to `docs/09-api-and-agent-contracts.md`.
- `backend/tests/test_api.py` — pytest coverage for implemented endpoints and envelope shape checks.
- `.github/workflows/backend-check.yml` — CI workflow for backend test execution and contract validation.
- `docs/17-backend-skeleton.md` — backend skeleton scope, envelope rules, CI behavior, and follow-up guidance.
- `docs/18-mobile-first-environment-strategy.md` — mobile-first, CI-first environment strategy before production setup.


## Phase 3 Analyze-Stock Stub and Mobile-First Strategy (PR #8)

- `POST /api/v1/analyze-stock` is implemented as a contract-first stub for Phase 4 readiness.
- The stub returns advisory-shaped placeholder fields, warnings, and human-decision framing, but performs no real stock analysis.
- The backend now includes validation/error-envelope coverage for malformed analyze-stock requests.
- `docs/18-mobile-first-environment-strategy.md` documents the CI-first, mobile-review operating model for Harness Engineering.
- `docs/19-first-analysis-workflow-stub.md` documents the implemented first-analysis stub behavior and Phase 4 follow-up path.

PR #8 does **not** add production Supabase setup, Railway deployment, live market data integration, brokerage execution integration, secrets, or real-money trading automation.

## Phase 4A First Analysis Workflow Skeleton (PR #10)

- `POST /api/v1/analyze-stock` now delegates to a deterministic local-only Phase 4A workflow skeleton.
- The current canonical analyze-stock contract uses `analysis_status = "phase4a_skeleton"` and `workflow_phase = "Phase 4A — Deterministic First Analysis Workflow Skeleton"`.
- The Phase 4A skeleton preserves advisory-only human-decision framing, required success/error envelopes, preferred strategy labels, and explicit warnings.
- The skeleton performs no live market data access, external API calls, persistence writes, production Supabase connection, broker execution, paper order creation, secrets usage, or real-money trading automation.
- `docs/21-first-analysis-workflow-skeleton.md` documents the current Phase 4A workflow stages, output fields, boundaries, and validation path.
